# CodeSpaces Removal Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove GitHub CodeSpaces dependencies from the VEX PROS C++ template.

## Files Removed
- `.devcontainer/` directory (entire folder)
  - `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for CodeSpaces
  - `devcontainer.json` - CodeSpaces environment setup

## Files Modified
- `README.md` - Updated to focus on local development instead of CodeSpaces
  - Removed CodeSpaces-specific quick start instructions
  - Added local development setup section
  - Updated project description to remove CodeSpaces references
  - Modified flashing instructions to prioritize local USB flashing
  - Added PROS CLI installation instructions

## Files Added
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommends PROS and C++ extensions for VS Code
- `.vscode/settings.json` - Configures C++ IntelliSense to use PROS

## Files Kept (No Changes)
- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow (useful for any development workflow)
- All source code files (`src/`, `include/`, etc.)
- Build configuration (`Makefile`, `project.pros`, etc.)

## Result
The template is now configured for local development and no longer requires GitHub CodeSpaces. Developers will need to:

1. Install PROS CLI locally
2. Clone/fork the repository to their local machine
3. Use `pros build` and `pros upload` commands for development

The GitHub Actions workflow continues to provide automated build verification for pull requests.
